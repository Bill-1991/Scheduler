## Installation
### Basic Setup
In order to follow further instruction and run this project on your local machine, you will need to install:

 - Javascript runtime environment - Node.js
 - Version control system - Git
 - Before you download anything, check if you don't have it installed already by issuing these commands to your terminal:

$ node -v

**v17.9.0**

$ git --version

**git version 2.25.1**
If you get command not found message, it's not installed.

For Windows users: I also personally recommend installing Windows Terminal where you can run git-bash shell rather than Command Prompt, which will allow you typing Linux commands on Windows.

1. Open your teminal
