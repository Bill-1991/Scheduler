## Installation
# Basic Setup
In order to follow further instruction and run this project on your local machine, you will need to install:

 - Javascript runtime environment - Node.js
 - Version control system - Git
 - Before you download anything, check if you don't have it installed already by issuing these commands to your terminal:

$ node -v
# v17.9.0
$ git --version
# git version 2.25.1
If you get command not found message, it's not installed.

For Windows users: I also personally recommend installing Windows Terminal where you can run git-bash shell rather than Command Prompt, which will allow you typing Linux commands on Windows.

# Running the project
Open your teminal
cd into your projects directory
Clone this repository to your local machine git clone https://github.com/GITHUB-USERNAME-GOES-HERE/fcc-forum-clone.git
Change to the project directory cd fcc-forum-clone
Make sure you are in the projects directory Linux: pwd should result in /home/me/fcc-projects/fcc-forum-clone Windows: Your prompt should look like this C:\Users\Me\fcc-projects\fcc-forum-clone>
Install the dependencies using npm program. npm install
Run the project npm start
